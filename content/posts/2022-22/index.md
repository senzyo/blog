## 测试可用性

以 Google DNS 为例: 

```bash
# DoH
curl -i https://dns.google/dns-query?dns=AAABAAABAAAAAAAAB2V4YW1wbGUDY29tAAABAAE
curl -i https://8.8.8.8/dns-query?dns=AAABAAABAAAAAAAAB2V4YW1wbGUDY29tAAABAAE
curl -s -H "accept: application/dns-json" "https://dns.google/resolve?name=example.com&type=A" | jq "." | grep data | cut -d '"' -f 4
curl -s -H "accept: application/dns-json" "https://8.8.8.8/resolve?name=example.com&type=A" | jq "." | grep data | cut -d '"' -f 4
# DoT
dig @dns.google -p 853 +tls +short A example.com
dig @8.8.8.8 -p 853 +tls +short A example.com
```

### Dandelion Sprout's Official DNS Server

[Dandelion Sprout's Official DNS Server](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/tree/master/Dandelion%20Sprout's%20Official%20DNS%20Server) is a personal DNS service hosted in Trondheim, Norway, using an AdGuard Home infrastructure.

Blocks more ads and malware than AdGuard DNS thanks to more advanced syntax, but goes easier on trackers, and blocks alt-right tabloids and most imageboards. Logging is used to improve its used filterlists (e.g. by unblocking sites that shouldn't have been blocked), and to determine the least bad times for server system updates.
